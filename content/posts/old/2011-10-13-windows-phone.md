Windows Phone, Windows Phone 7, Windows Phone 7.5. And still no change. Consumer is not attracted. I hear a lot about cool features and awesome innovations on various .NET podcasts. A lot is written in MSDN magazine and different .NET developer blogs. Yet consumer is not interested. Or maybe is not even aware of all the mighty potential that can be his or her just by trading the iconical iPhone for Windows logo. Heck, let the trends show what consumer is interested in:

Looking around, I can’t find a single one in use among my friends and co-workers. Ironically, quite a few of those happened to be developers as well. So where does it hide? Oh, maybe it masks under that apple logo?…

**Moral**

If you don’t give it to consumer, it doesn’t matter how great it is, it is still a failure.
