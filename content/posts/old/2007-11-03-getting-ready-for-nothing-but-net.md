JP has instructed the group to make certain things before the training course will start. So what is required to do the job?

* Visual Studio .NET 2005 Professional
* SQL Server 2005 Developer Edition /SQL Server Express
* ReSharper 3
* [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/)

TDD should cover things like:

* Continuous Integration with NAnt and CruiseControl .Net
* xUnit framework --> MbUnit

I am looking towards a very productive work. Things that according to JP "have made sneak appearances" in previous training (and I hope we get there):

* Log4Net
* Castle Windsor
* Castle Monorail
* NHibernate
