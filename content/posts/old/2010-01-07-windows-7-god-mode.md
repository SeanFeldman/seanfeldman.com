This is really funny. A friend of mine forwarded a link, where a little Windows 7 trick is described to get management links in one folder for Windows 7 system. Steps to reproduce are simple:

Create a folder with name **GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}**

This is what the folder looks like inside and the list was quite long (274 items):

That can be handy :)
