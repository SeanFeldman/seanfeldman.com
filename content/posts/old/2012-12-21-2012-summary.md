Year end is always an interesting time. Reminds a sort of retrospective, but that’s a geek in me that sees it that way. Yet what happened this year? A lot for me. Here’s a list of significant things for me:

* Leading and managing people are two different things, combining both and having good results is not an easy task
* Start-up experience, building from concept to a pilot
* Windows Azure experience, lessons learned from Cloud Services with NServiceBus
* Getting a little taste of Client Side “revolution” through knockout and backbone
* Power of ASP.NET MVC WebAPI and SignalR
* RavenDB (and document databases in general) awesomeness I wish I’d discover earlier
* And last, but not least, learning more about humans and myself

This was a good year, packed with lots of learning and new things. The goal for 2013 is to keep it that way and exceed.

Happy new year to everyone!
