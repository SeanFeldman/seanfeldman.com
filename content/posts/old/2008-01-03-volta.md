I was following the development on Script# CCC was developing. Sounded like an interesting idea of getting closer .NET and client-side JavaScript. Today found a link to MS experimental project called [Volta](http://labs.live.com/volta) (hmm, I wonder what will happen if you dare to touch it, same that happens to many experimental projects - a moment of joy and a big shocker at the end? :)
