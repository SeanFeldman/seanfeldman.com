If you have tried to build a web interface that would work for most of browsers and variety of devices, youâ€™ll appreciate [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html) project/framework.

Personally, I liked the following:

1. Decent documentation and examples
2. Ease of setup and use (nuget: Install-Package twitter.Bootstrap)
3. Intuitive rules names

Recent [DNC Magazine](http://www.dotnetcurry.com/magazine/dnc-magazine-issue1.aspx) has a starter article on how to get it going.
