If you’re running into a [bug](https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/813392/httpresponsemessage-content-headers-contentdisposition-is-null) like I did, there are good and bad news. Good – [Microsoft acknowledged](https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/813392/httpresponsemessage-content-headers-contentdisposition-is-null) this bug and will fix it, bad – it will happen in the next release (not sure then). In MS favour I have to admit that they turn things really quick, so who knows, it might be already in the release notes of the next release :)
