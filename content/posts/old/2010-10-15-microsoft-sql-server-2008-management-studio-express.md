I am so grateful to Graham O’Neale for blogging [his experience](http://goneale.com/2009/05/24/cant-install-microsoft-sql-server-2008-management-studio-express/) with installing Management Studio Express for  MS SQL Server 2008. This has definitely saved me time (and others based on comments).

In my case, I have installed Visual Studio .NET 2010 first, and then tried to install Management Studio Express.
