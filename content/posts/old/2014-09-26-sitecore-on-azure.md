This is old news, but still worth sharing. I have shared my architecture with folks from [The Azure Podcast](http://azpodcast.azurewebsites.net/) for discussion and suggestions. It was a good review and worth listening to.  In case you're interested, [Episode 32](http://azpodcast.azurewebsites.net/post/Episode-32-Moving-a-CMS-to-Azure) has the discussion from minute 20:30. This architecture is now running 3 of our production sites, with another one on its way for international support with multiple regions.

TLDR: Sitecore on Azure IaaS + Azure Cache (Redis) + Azure Websites / CDN = cost reduction + ease of development + inexpensive migration
