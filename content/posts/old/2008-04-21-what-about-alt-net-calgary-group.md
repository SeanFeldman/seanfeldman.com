<p>We have some very talented and blade sharp people here. So why can't we start ALT.NET Calgary local group? This would definitely promote excellent ideas around, enrich our dev community, put more stress on quality, agility, and much more. Feel free to contact me if interested. </p> <p>PS: I am quite inspired by what is going on right now at the ALT.NET conference. Wish would be there...</p>
