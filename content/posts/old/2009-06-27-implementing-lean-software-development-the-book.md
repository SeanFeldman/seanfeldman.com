After reading “[Implementing Lean Software Development](http://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/archive/2009/06/19/implementing-lean-software-development-the-book.aspx): From Concept [![image](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/Media/image_65C48DA3.png "image")](http://www.amazon.ca/Lean-Software-Development-Agile-Toolkit/dp/0321150783)to Cash”, I decided to look at the [original book](http://www.amazon.ca/Implementing-Lean-Software-Development-Concept/dp/0321437381). It is as good as the successor. IMO reading the original one first even better than just skipping to the new version.

Mary and Tom Poppenieck have greatly captured so many aspects of software development and how to do those lean way.
