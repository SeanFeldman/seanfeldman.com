[Unit Testing](http://www.typemock.com/) ASP.NET? [ASP.NET unit testing](http://www.typemock.com/ASP.NET_unit_testing_page.php) has never been this easy.   
Typemock is launching a new product for ASP.NET developers – the **ASP.NET Bundle** - and for the launch will be giving out **FREE licenses** to bloggers and their readers.

  
The ASP.NET Bundle is the ultimate ASP.NET unit testing solution, and offers both [Typemock Isolator](http://www.typemock.com/), a [unit test](http://www.typemock.com/) tool and [Ivonna](http://sm-art.biz/Ivonna.aspx), the Isolator add-on for [ASP.NET unit testing](http://sm-art.biz/Ivonna.aspx), for a bargain price.   


Typemock Isolator is a leading [.NET unit testing](http://www.typemock.com/) tool (C# and VB.NET) for many ‘hard to test’ technologies such as [SharePoint](http://typemock.com/sharepointpage.php), [ASP.NET](http://www.typemock.com/ASP.NET_unit_testing_page.php), [MVC](http://www.typemock.com/ASP.NET_unit_testing_page.php), [WCF](http://www.typemock.com/wcfpage.php), WPF, [Silverlight](http://www.typemock.com/Silverlight_unit_testing_page.php) and more. Note that for [unit testing Silverlight](http://www.typemock.com/Silverlight_unit_testing_page.php) there is an open source Isolator add-on called [SilverUnit](http://www.typemock.com/Silverlight_unit_testing_page.php).   
The first 60 bloggers who will blog this text in their blog and [tell us about it](http://blog.typemock.com/2009/05/get-free-typemock-licenses-aspnet.html), will get a Free Isolator ASP.NET Bundle license (Typemock Isolator + Ivonna). If you post this in an ASP.NET **dedicated** blog, you'll get a license automatically (even if more than 60 submit) during the first week of this announcement.   
Also 8 bloggers will get an **additional 2 licenses** (each) to give away to their readers / friends.   


Go ahead, click the following link for [more information](http://blog.typemock.com/2009/05/get-free-typemock-licenses-aspnet.html) on how to get your free license.

Update: This is what I received today, less than 24 hours after the post was published:

> Thank you for participating in the launch of our [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) bundle.
> 
> I am glad to inform you that you have qualified for a **free license** for the **[ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Bundle** ([Typemock Isolator](http://www.typemock.com/) personal edition + [Ivonna](http://sm-art.biz/Ivonna.aspx)), and that the license will be sent to you in the upcoming week.

Real deal.
