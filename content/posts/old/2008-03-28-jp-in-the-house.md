Today JP Boodhoo has visited the place I am working for to give a short idea what we should be doing to become more agile and walk the path of true developers. It was short, and we didn't have a chance to hit the base code (code never lies), but this is definitely will wake some up from the Matrix (later on this one).

So what did JP said? Mostly the same things he's being saying lately everywhere - be masters of your profession, put proud in what you are doing by perfecting it, and always remembering that client value is the priority number one. Do not stop trying to do better than you doing now, build you expertise in cores, don't chase the latest technology trends. Value communication with your fellow developers. Be honest with yourself and others on how well you perform and how much you need to improve.

My thoughts on this is - software you create is your face, do it the way you want others to see yourself, so you would not be ashamed, but proud, knowing that one day you will look back later and be able to do even better than that without having any regrets about earlier implementation. Love your profession or quit it.
