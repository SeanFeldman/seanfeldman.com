After a long time I had the book sitting idle, finally I had a chance to get my hands [![image](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/WindowsLiveWriter/Changes_EEBD/image_thumb.png)](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/WindowsLiveWriter/Changes_EEBD/image_2.png) on it - Who Moved My Cheese. A very nice, fairy tale kind-of book teaching how to cope with changes. I loved it, especially it's nice to read if you are trying to wrap around the agility concept.

Be ready for changes, be ready to change. Be ready for things become and stay dynamic. You have to be dynamic. Don't be a littlepeople, with a two complicated brain analysis to adopt to changes, be quick and pragmatic, adopt and period. Nice book, worth reading.

PS: I think I will introduce my son to this nice story. His brain is much better of adopting then mine :)
