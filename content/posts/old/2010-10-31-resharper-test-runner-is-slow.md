I love [R#](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/). It’s a great Add-on that makes Visual Studio .NET a usable tool. What I don’t like about R# is it’s test runner – so slow… I switched to use [TestDriven.NET](http://www.testdriven.net) almost two years ago. In the last few weeks had to go back to R# test runner. What a difference. I tried to capture the difference on a video, so that you’d see the difference between R# test runner, TD.NET, and command line build script that does everything (compile and test). By the looks of it, R# takes about the same time as command line script. A tool that does literally miracles with VS.NET should be a bit snappier IMO.

PS: I used free version of [Jing](http://www.techsmith.com/jing/) to capture the video since this is something I was using for a while. But to get it into AVI I used [free Microsoft Expression Encoder 4](http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/Encoder4_Overview.aspx), which I will be using as a capturing tool. Changing tools as you go, another blog post subject.

2010-11-03 Update: QAs at JetBrains are looking into the issue.
