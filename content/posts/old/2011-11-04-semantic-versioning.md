### I’ve been experimenting with build artefacts versioning for quite a while. Last time I was using major.minor.build.revision – this worked for us well, yet was not really significant for production operations. New place, new rules, and again into reviewing on how things are done. I am questioning the versioning schema I’ve used, and looking into alternatives. The best I have found so far is [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). Why this one? Several reasons.

1. It’s publicly documented

2. It makes sense from development and production operations point of view

What do you use and what experience did you have with Semantic versioning in that past?
