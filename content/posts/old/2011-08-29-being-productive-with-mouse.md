I am a big fan of [productivity](http://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/archive/2009/07/18/productivity-with-multiple-monitors.aspx) and for myself [mouse](http://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/archive/2008/04/09/pair-programming-keyboard-and-mice.aspx) is usually more of a drag than help when coding. While watching a presentation caught presenter using a mouse in a way I never did, and that was quite productive!

The objective was to create an entity for an ORM. Here’s how it went.

First, a code-first entity was created leveraging *prop* code snippet.

Then pressing ALT key and making of selection of “nothing” in front of all the properties *public* keyword, including the rows with the mouse. Thin blue line on the left represent this “selection”.

Last step is to type *virtual* and we are done. Now all the properties are marked as virtual for ORM’s satisfaction. What a great way of doing it!

Moral of the story – never say never. Mouse can make you productive sometimes as well ![Smile](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/Media/wlEmoticon-smile_1327F86D.png)
