<p>So now itâ€™s official. After 2 year with Cortex I am leaving. It was an extremely interesting period in my professional life. I was given an opportunity to work with so many great people and an outstanding group of developers, build a great team, exercise TDD/BDD development, experiment with agile processes, design and build systems that evolved the company business in electronic procurement and supply chain management. Among many other things that I could list here, I learned a big deal of human-related skills. In the business of software and computers, human skills are still one of the most important commodities that striving to acquire is necessary for any software developer that wants to be successful. </p>  <p>Every end is a beginning. I am excited to start another chapter in 2 weeks.</p>
