I have always wanted to be able to find free icons for the documents and visual explanations I was putting together, w/o violating any creator rights and yet being able to find quality items. Finally a co-worker of mine, [Eliot Negelev](http://www.elliotnegelev.com/), has showed me the site that does it: [IconFinder.com](http://www.iconfinder.com) Love it!
