Looking for help. I am trying to select a good .NET obfuscator tool that has to be:

1. Free
2. Supported (still developed)
3. Work well with command line (for automated build script)
4. Be flexible enough (configurable for options)

Right now [Babel Obfuscator](http://code.google.com/p/babelobfuscator/) looks good. My decision was based on analysis of possible tools listed on [this wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_.net_obfuscators). In case you have some input that can help me to do a better choice, feel free to leave comments. Appreciated.
