A lot of times you’ll look at something that you already know slightly different every single time. So is true with this book. It’s a great reference for C# as well as cover for the new features introduced in 4.0 (one of those [I have already blogged](http://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/archive/2010/10/28/dynamic-in-the-wild.aspx) about).
