Back in 2008 I joined [Cortex](http://www.cortex.net). I was lucky to join a dynamic and growing development team, not afraid of experimenting and pushing the boundaries of Test-driven development. We were on the learning curve from classical state and interaction-based testing to something bigger. [Terry](http://www.connicus.com/) and I started to look into ways to reduce the friction and repetition of test initialization and mocking framework usage (RhinoMocks at that time). This was the beginning of the BDD (behavior-driven development) test framework at Cortex that has since evolved into our standard for all of the projects.

Over time, the Cortex BDD test framework had evolved and grown, thanks to the entire team consistently improving upon the initial designs. I am excited to see it going public at the [Calgary .NET user group](http://www.dotnetcalgary.com/) presentation that will take on February 25th, presented by our colleague, [David](http://davidmorgantini.blogspot.com/).

If you are doing classic TDD or looking into BDD, I encourage you to attend the presentation to see what we are doing.

See you all there!
