While reading blogs during today morning, I read an interesting [one](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/jobs/20pre.html?_r=3), which captures the way I feel about Pair-Programming. I have my opinion before (old posts), and it’s slightly updated since then, but at the end I still think it’s a great way and not just to develop.
