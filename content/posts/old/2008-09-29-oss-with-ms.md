[This](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/09/28/jquery-and-microsoft.aspx) is definitely interesting turn of things. Rather than come with it's own exact copy of an existing product, MS will provide an OSS product as a part of a bundle. I wonder if there are more interesting and welcomed surprises coming from this direction.

We have used jQuery for a couple of recent project to save ourselves headaches on the client side, and the library is quiet impressive. Definitely good news.
