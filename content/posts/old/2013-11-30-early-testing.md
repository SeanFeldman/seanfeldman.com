Early testing is amazing. I am not talking about TDD and developers testing their own creation. I am talking about testing performed by professional QAs with mindset to hack the heck of your system (code, server, deployment, you name it). The value of early testing vs. late testing in SDLC is very easy to show to those that deal with with software on a daily basis and live it everyday. But how do you translate it to the business? Visualize it. One is high level – show one approach vs another and start asking questions.

Current project my team is working on we’ve decided to start testing early, while code in its dippers. Not only test it, but get a [Sentinel service from WhiteHat](https://www.whitehatsec.com/sentinel_services/sentinel_services.html) that is a on-going testing while we develop the product. Won’t outline all the benefits of the system, but mention what we got out of this as a business.

1. Finding serious deficiencies in our software
2. Fixing software flaws that would be security issues and bugs
3. Saved time on design changes while it is easy to accommodate those
4. Removed “surprise” component out of our software

#4 is the last but not the least from business point of view. Having confidence in your product is extremely important. We owe it to our stakeholders and our customers. Label it agile or common sense, it is great to do the right thing and see the results.
