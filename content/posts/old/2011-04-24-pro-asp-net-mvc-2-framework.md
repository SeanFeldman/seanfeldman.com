I have started this book long time ago, but never got to end of it. Finally, I had a [![image](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/Media/image_thumb_7277EB57.png "image")](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/Media/image_51286B88.png)chance to do so. What a great book. The cover says “The Expert’s Voice in .NET”, and I found Seven Sanderson a real expert in ASP.NET MVC.

In the past, I did a lot of WebForms work. These days I spend a lot working on ASP.NET MVC and like it way more. Primarily for the reasons of testability and being closer to the real web (stateless and mark-up).

If you are looking for a good ASP.NET MVC book or just a reference/refresher, this one is worth reading.
