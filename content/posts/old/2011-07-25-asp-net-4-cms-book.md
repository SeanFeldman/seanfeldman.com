I have looked for a book about CMS concepts and was excited to spot ASP.NET 4 CMS. As much as I was excited initially, that much I was disappointed as going through the book. Here a few things I did not find pleasant about it:

1. The book is **not** about CMS concepts and techniques. Vastly it’s about .NET 4.0 and tools the author wanted to talk about in order to share its own experience while building **a** CMS system.
2. Talking about new features of C# 4.0 and Visual Studio .NET 2010 in a CMS books is at least a waste of readers time.
3. Using WebForms and talking about clean mark-up (or Search Engine Optimization) was a bit of a slap in a face.

Either way, I am back to my search for a good book on CMS concepts and techniques.
