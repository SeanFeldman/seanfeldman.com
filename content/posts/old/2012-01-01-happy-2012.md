Life is a book. Each one of us is an author. Every year is a chapter. Every New Year eve we wish to start fresh, to begin a new chapter in our life. Let me wish you to live your next year in a such way, that you would be proud to add another chapter to your life book, proudly looking at the passing year and building on top of that many other chapters, full with love, happiness, great achievements, and people so dear to your heart.

  
Happy 2012.
