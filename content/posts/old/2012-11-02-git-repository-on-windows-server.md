Our group is moving to Git for code management and we were looking for in-house hosting option on Windows platform. I was surprised to find out that out of the box there are not many options. Rolling your own solution (aka setting it up manually) was not an option as we are a small group that is already tasked with enough work. So I started my search for free or paid options. You can guess that options were limited, yet one product I found has exceeded expectation and was just perfect – [SCM-Manager](http://www.scm-manager.org). Easy, simple, smooth integration with Active Directory and Jenkins build server. What else a boy needs ![Smile](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/Media/wlEmoticon-smile_3F177B71.png)Not to mention that it’s absolutely free. Amazing piece of work. Highly recommended.
