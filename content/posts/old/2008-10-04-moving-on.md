This is my goodbye post to [Sunwapta](http://sunwaptasolutions.com/), the company I spent 3 years with. Definitely, this was one of the most exciting experiences that have happened to me during my career as a software developer. People there have helped me to grow and mature, and for that I owe them my gratitude. I have learned tones. Thank you for keeping up with me and listening to all of the things I was bringing in. I hope when you run into code I had contribution to, it will bring up more of the positive thoughts and not the opposite. It is a bit sad to leave things not entirely finished, but I am more than confident that they will be done in the best way. After all, together we have done a [long way](http://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/archive/2008/07/23/challenge-listing-achievements.aspx) and learned awesome things that not only made us better developers, but also taught that pounding in code is not everything that matters, but thinking, analyzing, constantly improving, and most of all, never settling on mediocre, always striving to better.

I am stepping up to new challenges and moving to another company to gain more wisdom and hopefully contribute my knowledge. I can sense this is going to be an exciting journey packed with awesome challenges. So [Cortex](http://cortex.net/), here I come!
