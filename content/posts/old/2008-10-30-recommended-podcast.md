This is late news, but I really recommend listening to the podcast with [Robert C. Martin](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=388) on .NET Rocks! Decided to listen to this one as a result of the book have read a while ago, [Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#](http://www.amazon.ca/Agile-Principles-Patterns-Practices-C/dp/0131857258/). The guy who has spent over 30 years trying to figure out how to do software, has some ideas to inspire how you do things. Audience? Developers, managers, users. Anyone. This is a great content to listen to.
