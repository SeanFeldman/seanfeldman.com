I have [posted before](http://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/archive/2010/07/01/bizmonade.aspx) about Bizmonade testing library for BizTalk orchestrations testing. Unfortunately, there’s something something that looks like a limitation – testing orchestrations that receive any document type (System.Xml.XmlDocument). I [posted a question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3191586/bizmonade-testing-orchestration-that-receives-any-document) on StackOverflow and curious to see if get anything at all. How do you test your general schema orchestrations?

Update 2010-07-08: I'm in contact with the main developer of Bizmonade, and he'll be releasing soon an updated version that will allow scenario I am looking for.
