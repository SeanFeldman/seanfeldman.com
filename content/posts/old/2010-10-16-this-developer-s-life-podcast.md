The other day I was listening to This Developer’s Life podcast, episode 1 – [Getting Fired](http://thisdeveloperslife.com/post/1203177584/1-0-1-getting-fired). Please don’t confused, I am not getting fired (yet), but I find it very interesting how Rob formulated his experience. I also completely in agreement with [Oren Eini](http://ayende.com/blog). Being honest (not rude) is a key to successful work relationship. Dealing with people is not always logical, therefore the importance of way things are communicated sometimes exceed the message itself.
