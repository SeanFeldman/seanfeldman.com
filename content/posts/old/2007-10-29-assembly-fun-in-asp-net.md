I used to be a big fan of Assembly (x86) in the past when doing graphics for the ancient 320x200x256 and later when lecturing about 80x86 to practical engineers. These days I don't do that anymore, but I think knowing the basics does make sense.

This project is nice - it allows to run x86 code in ASP.NET.
