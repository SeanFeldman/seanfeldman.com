I have ran into an interesting message when opened a user group site in Visual Studio (not something that I usually do) and it made me wonder

1. What version of IE Visual Studio 2012 Update 2 CTP is using if not the one found on machine (IE9 on my Windows 7)

2. Google is playing dirty… this message would only show up in IE version 8 and lower.
