[JP](http://blog.jpboodhoo.com/) called me out, so here I am, trying to travel back in time to recall how the heck I ended up coding.

**How old were you when you first started in programming?**

I was 16 years old when I touched computer for the first time with intension of more than just playing a video game. Not that I was a big gamer before that - I was not. I got my 1st computer when I was 16.

**How did you get started in programming?**

By accident, accident that took place at school. I had a subject called "Programming", and was doing well on everything, besides this one. My mom met the teacher who advised to purchase a computer for me, so I could practice more and get better grades in programming. So my mom did. Anticipated results were confirmed, partially. I improved my marks on programming significantly, abandoning the rest of the subjects behind. Got myself into programing graphics, demos, 3D. And that probably what can be tagged as the source of the decease.

**What was your first programming language?**

Pascal.

**What was the first real program you wrote?**

A demo for the local demo competition my friend and I put together. This was the first time I actually exposed what I was into publicly, letting the word "geek" stick to my first name, partially replacing the last name.

**What languages have you used since you started programming?**

Hebrew, English, Russian... ah, programming languages!

Pascal, Delphi, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, DHTML, Assembly x86, T-SQL, VB6, VB.NET, C#.

**What was your first professional programming gig?**

Back in 2001, putting together the theory and the practicality at my first workplace.

**If you knew then what you know now, would you have started programming?**

Yes, yes, and yes. I would not change a thing in a way it started (at what age and circumstances), but I would definitely pay more attention to the wise advices I disposed through so many years, especially in the begriming.

**If there is one thing you learned along the way that you would tell new developers, what would it be?**

Stick to what you believe into, go forward to achieve your targets, but be careful not to become an ego-bully. Perfect yourself as a developer, knowing that perfect does not exist in nature, and yet not loosing your dream of doing better than you've done so far. Remember that as developers we use computers to accomplish our mission, but worked, working, and will work with real human beings, that are not computers.

**What's the most fun you've ever had programming?**

Being able to affect other developers. The power of satisfaction from being able to positively affect other developers around, constantly improve myself to allow surrounding do the same - is amazing. Finding friends that are also developers and as crazy about things that we do as I am, is the most fun, knowing that you are not the only one, and if locked up in an institution, you will have your good friends with ya.
