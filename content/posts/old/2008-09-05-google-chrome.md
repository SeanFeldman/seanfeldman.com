This is old news, but Google apparently has release a browser to speed things up (according to Google most of the current browsers are not performing well with CSS, JavaScript, and whole rendering). From a scratch approach worked not bad at all. Though there are several things that are working against this new browser:

1. Keyboard shortcuts - right now you have to use a mouse to close a tab, or open a new one, or access downloaded files and much more.
2. Absence of add-ins - one of the strong promoting features for FireFox was a massive support for custom add-ins. Having at least a few and showing that it's the direction would not heart at all. On the other hand, maybe it's not necessarily the direction Google wants to go (and not follow).

Overall - quick, clean, will evaluate more.
