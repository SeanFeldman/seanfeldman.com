I had a long plan to demonstrate in an animated way a software project [progress without using any software](http://animoto.com/play/lLsnERX0HNzj0IAZVG00Yw) or what is know in agile as Sticky Borad (stickies board). Wanted to capture the process of thought, the evolution and how things are dynamically progressing. The chance finally came to do so.

This is my 300th blog on weblogs.asp.net â€“ circle being closed.
