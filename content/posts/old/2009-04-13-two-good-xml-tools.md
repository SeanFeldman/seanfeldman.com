I was working a lot lately with regular expressions and XPath. As usual in scenario like this, you want to have a good tool to assist your tests writing. For regular expressions I used [Rad Software Regular Expression Designer](http://www.radsoftware.com.au/regexdesigner/) that does a good job of matching and replacements. For XPath, I used [SketchPath 2.0](http://pgfearo.googlepages.com/) which is really friendly and great to use. Both are free for usage.

Feel free to comment on other useful tool youâ€™ve encountered for XML and XPath.
