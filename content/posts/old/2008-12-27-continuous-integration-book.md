First my personal impression - this book is a very good "business case" to introduce[![image](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/WindowsLiveWriter/ContinuousIntegrationbook_13100/image_3.png)](http://www.amazon.ca/Continuous-Integration-Improving-Software-Reducing/dp/0321336380/)Â  things like automated builds, CI server, DB continuous integration (loved the word CDBI), automated deployment, automated inspection - most of the things that CI leverages. It doesn't go into deep details of one or another particular technology, balancing most of examples between (mostly) Java and .NET worlds.

From my personal experience, if your company doesn't practice CI in any shape or form and shows no interest in it, using excuses like "we deploy internally", "our deployment consist of a few assemblies and content files", or worse "there's no real benefit in it" - think twice if you are in the right place and do your math.

CI is simple to start, it's free, and most of all, ROI is guaranteed.
