This is not a technical post. Nor it's related to software development or the theory behind it. It is a pure human post about principles that are much more basic and important in life then anything else - family.

My wife and kids have left for their spring-summer vacation about two months leaving me behind to catch up later. Two days and I am on my way to see them, reunite and spend a one hell of the month in the place I love - Israel.

These two month were an interesting period of time for myself. I have made a few decisions two change the way I do things. Realized how much I care and love my family. Learned to appreciate my own time, and see the things normally I cannot see from a distance of a meter - time goes by quickly and I have to make the difference every single day. Difference as dad, as husband, as a software developer, as a human.

Saying this I realize how much I still have to go/do. Very exciting. The vacation will give me some rest I need. Seeing my family will boost my moral. My family is great. I love you Anna, Liam and Liz. Here's [my family on current vacation](http://animoto.com/play/Y61qgxWY9jlGqtwZgvxiTw) (thanks to [Roy Osherov](http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/) for pointing out the web service, sorry, the track is the same - tried to be original, but this one is really good:).

PS: yes, and the warm weather - that is an important ingredient for a fun time! Make it double please.
