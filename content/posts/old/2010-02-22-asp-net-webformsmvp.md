<p>First it was classic ASP, then ASP.NET with WebForms. At the previous company I used to work with it implementing Model-View-Presenter. Since then, I have not touched web development a lot. A lot has changed, and the biggest addition was ASP.NET MVC Framework. Now, there’s a new kid on the blog, that gives ASP.NET WebForms a second change – <a href="http://webformsmvp.com/" target="_blank">WebFormsMVP</a>. Check it out.</p>
