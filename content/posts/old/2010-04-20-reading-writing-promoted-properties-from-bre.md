[ESB Toolkit Extensions](http://esbextlibrary.codeplex.com/) is an open-source library giving you an extended BRE/BRI provider to read and write promoted properties of a message within business rules engine. Iâ€™ve used it to achieve automated process for mapping to canonical schema and then back to destination schema based on receiver ID as a promoted property (will blog on this later). A very useful library!![image](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/Media/image_thumb_41B1A79E.png "image")
