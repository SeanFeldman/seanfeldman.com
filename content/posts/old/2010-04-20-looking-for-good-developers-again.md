Here I am shouting again about the fact that we are looking for good
developers. Our team has matured, and now definition of a “good developer” is
not what we used to think of it before. Don’t misunderstand me, we are looking
from smart people, but also rounded people.

Our team has shrunk by one developer, whom ironically [I welcomed aboard](http://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/archive/2009/01/08/welcome-a-board-david.aspx) a little more than a year ago. Life is life,
and things are dynamic. I wish him good luck, and hope to see the replacement
coming soon.

So if you are in Calgary area and happened to be .NET / BizTalk / Agile
developer – drop me a note.
