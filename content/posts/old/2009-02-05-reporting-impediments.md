During the scrums we report what we did yesterday, planning to do today, and what are the impediments. Impediments sometimes tend to sound like a complaint. So what to do to prevent it become just "bitching" about things?

1. Don't complaint. Bring impediment to an attention with a very short and pragmatic preposition how to remove it. If you can't make such a note or just don't have one, don't complaint ("Report impediment, not complaints").

2. Look what can be learned and withdrawn as an experience from the impediment, and use that knowledge to prevent a similar impediment in the future ("Turn enemy into ally").

These two simple guidelines can avoid [Dilbert's understanding of Agile](http://www.globalnerdy.com/2007/11/28/dilbert-on-extreme-and-agile-programming/).
