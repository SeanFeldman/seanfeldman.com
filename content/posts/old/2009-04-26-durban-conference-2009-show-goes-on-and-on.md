This post is political.

I am just glad that along with Israel, Canada and US did not take part in this pre-arranged "show". Boy oh boy, an international conference masqueraded with good intentions, and leading to the same old thing - hatred for Jews and state of Israel. Now ask the question yourself: do you trust UN and everything you hear? Cause I wouldn't.

Some countries representatives have left in order to [boycott](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AThlfpt335I) the speech, and this is where I am not sure if that was in solidarity to what was done to Israel, or because they felt attacked. Either way, I hope they will open their eyes, and stop participating ahead.

PS: The [speech of the president of Iran](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPcvfGZ4g74) had some brilliant timing - close to the Holocaust day. And the world applauded to the speech. Now will people wake up to see the truth?
