I'd like to drop a few word for the book was lucky to read lately - **Fearless Change: Patterns for Introducing New Ideas**.Â  Authors of the book have [![](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/WindowsLiveWriter/7f08911e0633_11834/image_3.png)](http://www.amazon.ca/Fearless-Change-Patterns-Introducing-Ideas/dp/0201741571)succeeded to capture ways to apply changes in amazingly accurate way. Written as a pattern book with orientation for software development (and not only) this book makes a perfect read for those who are willing to make changes and affect others.
