I had an [old post](http://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/archive/2008/07/17/data-driven-or-domain-driven-application.aspx), back in July 2008, where I had a few comments on Data Driven vs. Domain Driven applications. It will be almost a year soon since that post, and I have definitely learned a lot since then. One thing I learned for sure, is to pick your the battles. You cannot fight a developer who knows data driven applications since day one and nothing else, that domain driven applications are not necessarily more ‘efficient’, but more maintainable, allow better link between domain concept and software, allow change, pass the reality tests when change in business is coming. It’s the same as trying to convince someone who spent 2/3 of his career without testing and sees no value in it, suddenly to start TDD or even ‘worse’, BDD. Why to bother? I know my stuff well, don’t I? Look, XX years in the industry are not wasted. No, they are invested with a little ROI. But these are religious wars. Useless. Therefore I am off the topic, and just learning, exploring, and implementing things I see the right way at the given moment. Once you concentrate on doing that rather than chasing ghosts to convince, you realize what is right and what is wrong, without a need in side-kicks.

So this is the end of discussion for me. Why did I post this? Well, it was funny to get today a comment, referencing the post. I forgot it long time ago, but someone is still fighting the fight he will eventually lose…
