I am amazed. Not everyday you can find a great application that just works the way you expect it to work. [Hudson](https://hudson.dev.java.net/) is our teams’ CI engine of choice. We used [CruiseControl](http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/), but it is no where close to what Hudson is capable.

Features I loved most of all:

* Ajax updates for the web interface
* Real time report of the projects statuses
* Console of the build (see the script execution)
* Integration with AD
* Integration with Subversion (providing comments on commits)
* Recent changes
* Workspace (ZIPed trunk)
* Real-time Build Executor Status
* and much more…

We are less then a month on CI server, and Hudson is only a few days as introduced, but from now on there will be no project outside of it. So what’s the status, doc? Cloudy, but we are getting warmer and sun will eventually shine (a nice visual gimmick for Hudson to report the status :)
