JetBrains has released the [beta version of their tool](http://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/?dotnetblog) that can replace Reflector. Just the navigation around with R# like shortcuts is worth trying it. I tried [Telerik’s JustDecompile](http://www.telerik.com/products/decompiling.aspx), though it wasn’t as good as dotPeek. ILSpy is another player on the field, that I have tried to use. So far the leader is dotPeek. Let’s see how the game will go. Once thing is obvious – Reflector is loosing.
