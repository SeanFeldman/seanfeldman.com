It is nice once in a while to get back to the course or training session you took and make sure that you haven't wasted your time for nothing. This is not about ego, this is about making sure that what ever you know today will be absolutely no enough tomorrow and constantly remind yourself this basic law of software development.

I am lucky to TA at JP's Nothing But .NET boot camp. Unlike MSDN events, NBDN is a whole different story. If you heard of it and were hesitating, or doubting if it is for you at all - my answer would be short - if you are hungry for knowledge and always looking how to improve yourself - get it.

It takes a little to generate a big change, a boot camp like this is that little that you can do to change how you work and what you produce. Check it out!
