Over the weekend I had a chance to play a bit with the [tutorials](http://blogs.hibernatingrhinos.com/nhibernate/Default.aspx) provided by Gabriel Schenker for NHibernate 2.0 TDD style. A few thoughts on the subjects:

* NHibernate is powerful for especially Domain oriented solutions
* Feels a few orders more mature than the ADO.NET\* approaches (Have to admit, I am not a big fan of ADO.NET - and at work people don't like that. Hopefully they will be able to see in NHibernate what I saw for myself)
* Definitely helps to shift the focus on the right problems (not how to persist and cache, but how to resolve the real problem - logic of the solution for the domain, not technology)

I will be continuing with those tutorial, trying to learn more and see how and when can introduce it in our code. The fact that you can do you testing without having an actual database is thrilling (in a good way) and exciting. What I am missing at this point is some good literature recommendation that is more .NET oriented, with accent on the version that supports Generics and HCQ (HQL is a bit too SQL-ish to me).
