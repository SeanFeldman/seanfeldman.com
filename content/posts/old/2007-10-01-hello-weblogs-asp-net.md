This is the 1st post on this site. My [MSN Blog](http://seanfeldman.spaces.live.com/) will be updated, but this is going to be the primarily one.   I am interested in posting to weblogs.asp.net the whole text, and just a preview to the old MSN blog - anyone knows how to do it from Windows Live Writer?
