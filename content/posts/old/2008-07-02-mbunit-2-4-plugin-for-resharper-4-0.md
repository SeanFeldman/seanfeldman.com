[Albert Weinert](http://der-albertcom/) has release an update to his [plugin](http://der-albert.de/archive/2008/06/13/mbunit-2.4-plugin-for-resharper-4.0-final.aspx) to allow execution of R# 4.0 from within Visual Studio .NET 2005 / 2008. The only Unit Testing framework supported by R# 4.0 out of box is NUnit, so this is a useful plugin for those who prefer MbUnit to NUnit.

I recall that one of the final features for R# 4.0 was planned to provide out-of-box plugins and support for several Unit Testing frameworks. Wonder what happened to that plan.
