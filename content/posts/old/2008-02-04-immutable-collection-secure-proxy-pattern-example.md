Mr. Mo has wrote a nice [post](http://mokhan.ca/blog/2008/02/02/Keep+The+Ruffians+Out.aspx) about securing collection and turning it into an immutable object. I am adding my 20 cents by reminding a great example JP Boodhoo has showed during his ["Nothin But .NET"](http://www.jpboodhoo.com/blog/NothinButNetAustinTXApril7th11th.aspx) training session, leveraging [ReadOnlyCollection<T>](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms132474(VS.80).aspx) class to make a collection immutable.
