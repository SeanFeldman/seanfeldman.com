Writing a Custom ConfigurationSection is not a big task, but can be very challenging if you forget some details. I loved [this post](http://www.abhisheksur.com/2011/09/writing-custom-configurationsection-to.html) as it reminded me that you have to have both the Section tag and the collection within it tagâ€¦ dah!
