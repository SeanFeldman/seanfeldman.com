Good reading, especially if you have to  catch up from C# 1.0 or 2.0 to the latest 3.0. The other one I would like to read now will have to be a mix of this book (without 1.0/2.0 materials) and the excellent ["CLR via C#"](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0735621632) by  Jeffery Richter.

Until that mix is out, I am switching back to Domain Design/Modeling. ["Domain Driven Design"](http://www.amazon.ca/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215) by Eric Evans is the only one I read, loved, was confused with, and have to re-read. But what is missing is the practicality (the modeling part?). Would love to hear about the Domain Modeling books you have to recommend (and they don't have to be necessarily in .NET neither C#).
