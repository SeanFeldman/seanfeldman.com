Looking for some feedback from ASP.NET community - *are you using ORM mapping tool and how disconnected your business logic from the persistence during initial development*?

To give a hint, I was looking at NHibernate, Microsoft Entities Framework, and in-house grown entities framework based on DB schema-first as opposed to the pure ADO.NET direct access. Thanks.
