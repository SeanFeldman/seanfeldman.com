This [book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596527675) is gold. Dig it!Â  [![book cover](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/WindowsLiveWriter/TheArtofAgileDevelopmentBook_AA36/image_5.png)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596527675)

The timing is amazing. Right after I posted the [Team Work](http://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/archive/2008/09/17/team-work.aspx) entry, I received the book and couldn't stop reading it. Should read it to the end, but had to comment and let others know how good it is. Amazon rating was quite successful this time (12 five stars, 1 one star).

The book is not packed with code and patterns, but with other type of wisdom that is required no less than good programming skills IMO. I could definitely associate written with myself and mistakes I have done in the past and reflect the ways I was dealing with those and how authors of the books have done that. Learning from others mistakes is valuable, learning how to prevent future mistakes be applying techniques and analyzing situations - real gem.

To add to that, the [references](http://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/archive/2008/07/24/fearless-change-patterns-for-introducing-new-ideas.aspx) that authors are giving are excellent as well, (books/materials) I definitely find useful for myself.

Note: make sure you are going to the .com site - this one has the Search Inside feature on the book. I went to the local site (.ca) and it was missing.
