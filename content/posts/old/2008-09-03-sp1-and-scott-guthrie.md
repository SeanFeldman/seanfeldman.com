Ok, so I was really upset and spilled a bit more than probably should have to. ScottGu has picked my desperate yell from the blog and suggested a help (2nd time I believe - 1st one occurred when .NET 2.0 SP1 has broken our production web sites, wow, he's good). Apparently there was an issue with SP1 **Beta** and R# 4.0. I already went through refresh on installs (including removal of addins and components). Plan vanilla .NET FW with Service Packs with no addins installed works fine (well, not crushing, working without R# is impossible).

Since JetBrains just released version 4.1 of R#, it was natural to install it with the refreshed installation I had and see if it's all working or now. It worked, wow, interesting...

Taking a moment and stepping back from this v.XX sp.YY madness I would like to express a huge thank you to Scott -- he didn't have to read the blog, neither I was asking for help, yet he did get involved, and involved a team as well.

My vote goes to replicate this man at MS and assign to more products! Thanks Scott.
