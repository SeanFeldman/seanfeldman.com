[This post](http://resharper.blogspot.com/2008/10/resharper-combos-breaking-aggregation.html) shows a good example of how to refactor your code to preserve Law of Demeter. Very clean and simple example. R# is there for the refactoring part, to make things less manual and friction free. As a reminder, Law of Demeter:

 Each unit should have only limited
knowledge about other units: only units "closely" related to the
current unit. Or: Each unit should only talk to its friends; Don't talk
to strangers.
