It is a great honour to work with the [person](http://agilewarrior.wordpress.com/) who wrote the [book](http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Samurai-Masters-Deliver-Software/dp/1934356581) I[![image](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/Media/image_1D544DB9.png "image")](http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Samurai-Masters-Deliver-Software/dp/1934356581) just recently finished reading. The Agile Samurai is a mix of project management and software development. It’s a reality check helper if you are trying to run agile process in your company/team/project. The intention of this post is not to review the book, this is what I will do later at Amazon. Jonathan has managed to make me think of certain things in a different manner, maybe a little bit more realistic. There are a few new tools I can put under my belt ([Inception Deck](http://www.pragprog.com/magazines/2010-10/way-of-the-agile-warrior)) to move forward with. The most important message from the book IMHO was not taking Agile literally as written - fluctuate, experiment, and question.
