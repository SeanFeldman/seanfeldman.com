We are ramping up on our development of a new version of existing system that [![Learning NServiceBus](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71tDf-19HrL.jpg "Learning NServiceBus book")](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-NServiceBus-David-Boike/dp/1782166343)will utilize NServiceBus for communication between its various parts. [Learning NServiceBus](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-NServiceBus-David-Boike/dp/1782166343) is a great resource to get going, especially if you need in short time to go from 0 to 100. The books falls a little short on testing IMO, but it gives you enough to move in the right direction. In case you are planning to deviate from a standard transport (MSMQ), you wonâ€™t find a lot of help in this book. Though frankly, outstanding NServiceBus team and amazing community behind it will answer any of your questions, if those were not already answered. Since NServiceBus is now under Particular, this is the new [user group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/particularsoftware) you want to send your questions to.

In my future posts, I will talk a little more about how we are designing our new system and going to use NServiceBus with Azure transport, which opens up so many opportunities and fascinating architecture options.
