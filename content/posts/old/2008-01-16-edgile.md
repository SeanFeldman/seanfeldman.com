Combining client-side with server-side, coping with multi-browser support, handling imperfect world of CSS , implementing the code the best way you can relaying on patterns and principles with legacy code kicking around, keeping up with the pace of changing, facing clients that are not ready to pay for the quality, dealing with team mates that are still loyal to procedural code order and married to databases, yet not over-designing is more than just agile. My definition of this is going on the edge with agility in mind. Or just Edgility.
