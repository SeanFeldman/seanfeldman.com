Just finished reading [Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131857258/ref=wl_it_dp?ie=UTF8&coliid=I2PVXDJUDOGLTB&colid=2J45ANE21AADN) from Robert and Micah Fowler Martin. A definitely recommended book. Some stuff is not taking advantage of the .NET (not using generics where could do that, Visitor pattern for example.

Next book - [Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321125215/ref=wl_it_dp?ie=UTF8&coliid=I33DSTDXCA7MA6&colid=2J45ANE21AADN). What else would you recommend that would fall into this category?
