[Purely Personal]

“Never give up, never surrender” was my favourite part from the Space Odyssey. Today it proved to be true again. How do you lift the skills of the team? By lifting the overall skills, by raising the bar for the whole team. This was the GCD is lifted, forcing the less strong developers to invest more, rather than doing an opposite, forcing the strong developers to play dummy.

Why do I writing this at all? Because I appreciate when people are brave enough to call white a white and black a black, and not just call it a shade of grey. Today I managed to bring back the skills lifting back to the team. This is a great opportunity to prove that by sharing the knowledge more can be achieved. Admitting mistakes made to fix those is the right step in a better direction.
