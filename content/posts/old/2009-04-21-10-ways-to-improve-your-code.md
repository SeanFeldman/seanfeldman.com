[Neal Ford](http://memeagora.blogspot.com/) had an interesting [presentation](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/10-Ways-to-Better-Code-Neal-Ford) at InfoQ. An interesting presentation. One part was funny, is to hear from a core Java guy calling Pocos by a funky name “Ponos” :) Well, besides the fact it’s not the name we (.NET folks) use, it’s also funny to hear if you know the [similar Russian word](http://oules.lightentertainment.org/Old%20site/myths/poo.html).
