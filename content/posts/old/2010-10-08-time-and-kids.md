This is not a technical post.

A while ago I was told that you always have time, you just don’t know how to manage it. I tried to resist to that person, knowing nothing about life of family with little kids. Yes, you can make “borrow” some time from family and kids, but that is **not** an option I would take.

The article below is a very accurate description of what it’s like, and highly recommended to those “that know better” :)
