I run into something really annoying this morning with Itinerary DSL in VS.NET designer. The only way to create an itinerary is to create it in a project of a library type. This is confusing, since for a simple application, I should be able to achieve the same with a plain BizTalk project. The ironic part is that within BizTalk project creation of itinerary IS an option, but when selected, add a new (standard) BizTalk item dialog shows up, with no itinerary in it. A bug?
