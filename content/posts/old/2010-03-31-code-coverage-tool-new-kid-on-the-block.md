We are utilizing NCover to perform code coverage as a part of CI process on the build server. On development machines, at least for now, we don’t have it (which is a bummer). PartCover (a free alternative to NCover) is not there yet, so we waited till the right time would come to buy workstation licenses. It looks like the time is almost right. JetBrains has announced they will release [dotCover tool](http://www.jetbrains.com/dotcover/) starting with the traditional EAP program (which is well known from R#).

Personally, I am excited. Pretty sure the tool will rock and will give NCover some competition. Looking forward it!
