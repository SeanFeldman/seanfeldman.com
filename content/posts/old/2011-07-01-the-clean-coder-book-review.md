Uncle Bob did it again. Another book that is full of experience and wisdom. This time it’s not about code, it’s about being a professional developer and what it means. I really loved the book. There were so many examples that I couldn’t not to smile recalling instances from my own experience having parallels with what is described in the book. One particular sentence I really loved was about TDD:

> “I know this sounds strident and unilateral, but given the record I don’t think surgeons should have to defend hand-washing, and I don’t think programmers should have to defend TDD.”

So true. This is exactly what I felt like every single time a discussion around “justification for doing TDD/BDD” came up. If I’d decide on CS students reading materials, this one would make it on the list.
