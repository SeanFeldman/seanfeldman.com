Today I'm happy to be a team leader. The reason - I managed to convince the management to get ReSharper for all our developers. I'm more than convinced that developers will find it more than useful. The problem is where to send them to have the best and quickest tutorials of the most useful features. If you have links and don't mind to share - grate.

Has anyone tried to write plugins for R#?
