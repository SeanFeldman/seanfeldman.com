I have attended Enterprise Development with NServiceBus course last week. Interestingly, a lot of questions I had back a while ago where answered. Either I was missing the knowledge, or not asking the right questions. Either way, [what I was trying](http://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/archive/2010/09/21/consuming-wcf-service-from-biztalk.aspx) to accomplish a year and something ago with BizTalk could be done ten times simpler with NSB. BizTalk was a great tool for mapping, but definitely neither a services platform nor a bus. Long-term running processes with BizTalk (aka [Orchestrations](http://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/archive/2010/07/12/debugging-biztalk-orchestrations.aspx)) felt plain wrong. The fact that one was not able to test the bread and butter of a business process w/o having a full end to end integration testing was mind blowing. [Creating messages](http://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/archive/2010/09/29/creating-biztalk-message-in-custom-net-component.aspx) outside of BizTalk has felt like a shameful sin.

[Training at Austin](http://info.headspring.com/nservicebus-training/?utm_campaign=NSB-Details-Udi&utm_source=Social%20Media) with [Jimmy Bogard](http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/) ([Headspring](http://www.headspring.com/)) is a good start to get you going if you wondering around SOA / Bus maze and want clarity.
