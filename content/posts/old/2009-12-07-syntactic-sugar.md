Well, I wish there was a way of getting away from *SyntaticSugar* static class initial point, and be able just to do plain code

```

Do(() => request.Headers = Headers).If(HeadersExist);

```

Or even better, this

```

(request.Headers = Headers).If(HeadersExist);

```
Thereâ€™s always hope for next version of C# ;)
