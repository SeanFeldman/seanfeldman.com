Yesterday I watched [Food Inc.](http://www.foodincmovie.com/) documentary movie. And this morning, hours after watching it, on the radio they announce salads recall – [Salmonella bacteria contamination](http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/corpaffr/recarapp/2010/20100525e.shtml). Wonderful. Another proof of house mass production (and not just food) can go and goes wrong. The movie is highly recommended.
