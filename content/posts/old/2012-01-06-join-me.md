Working with remote team members can be sometimes challenging. Working with temporary team members is even more challenging. IT can sometime get in your way when you need screen sharing, and you need it fast. Typically I’d go first with the official route – IT provided service (in case company provides that service or has acquired it), VNC (if IT supports it), or something else, more creative.

Working with a particular vendor yesterday, I had to share something really quick and didn’t have a way to do so. They have asked me to go to [join.me](http://join.me) and click “share”. Boy I got excited by simplicity – within seconds we had screen sharing/controlling going on. No heavy client installation, just a lightweight thin application, no registration, invitation is easy to create, multiple users connecting, sharing mouse/keyboard. And all this for free. Love it.
