Nice to see BDD spreading quickly around. Reminds me how about two ago I wanted to switch our company from ASP.NET web forms to MVC, to allow better introduction into testability. This video just reminded me how correct that assumption was. And these days, with the tools like MSpec and support out of box by R# and VS.NET – it’s a must. Enjoy the [video](http://blogs.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2010/05/jetbrains-vendor-session-at-devconnections-now-available/).

PS: one thing I didn’t like in particular, if you talk about mocking, show it, don’t just leave it in words. Otherwise it’s a bad service for novice that want to see it in action.
