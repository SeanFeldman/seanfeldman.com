**This is political**, skip it if it’s not what you normally would like to read.

Today I learned about Baha’i leaders in Iran being charged for *spying in favor of Israel, insulting religious sanctities and propaganda against the Islamic Republic*. My reaction was – what a bull. Besides the fact that the country is running like a show, this type of accusation is just ridiculous. Where’s the logic? If someone would spy in favor of Israel, would they spread propaganda against the Islamic Republic? Don’t think so…

Personally, I can clearly see what Iran is up to and what they are trying to provoke. The game is old, and everyone knows its’ name. Sadly, I am no longer surprised about how weak and incapable of deeds the modern society is, when it comes to situations like this.
