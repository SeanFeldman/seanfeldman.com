For somone who has expertise in PHP and not Razor/ASPX views [Phalanger](http://www.php-compiler.net/) might be a great middle ground. This is an [integration](http://www.infoq.com/articles/Phalanger) of PHP and .NET. Always great to see another language join the .NET club ![Smile](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/Media/wlEmoticon-smile_0B6D26AE.png)
