I know there are lots of good developers in Calgary. I know for sure lots of them feel sort of puzzled if they do things the right way. If you have a chance, get your answers at the [course JP is giving in Calgary](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/279353554) [again](http://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/archive/2007/11/07/nothing-but-net-calgary-2007-day-1.aspx) â€“ absolutely worth it. As someone who took the course a year ago, I can testify you will not be disappointed, unless code is not what you love to do. Yes, love to do, and not like, since to get through the course you gotta be loving programming. What will this course give you? I think some of the most valuable things a developer can ask for:

- Sanity check: Am I doing the right thing?

- Back to the basic: Technology will come and go, core principles will stay. Do I know what are those?

- Testing is important: Is test only to discover bugs or more than that?

This year JP is changing the way course is done for better (IMO). Sign up and see how deep the rabbit hole goes.
