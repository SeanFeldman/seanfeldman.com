It is very hard to provide an honest opinion when you are involved in a situation. I found it always difficult for myself and admired people of being able to do it, lifting themselves from emotional attachments to the matter.

I am a big fan (if not huge) of the whole Google Apps platform. I use heavily Gmail, rely a lot on Google Calendar, abandoned Excel for simple-to-average stuff and went with Google spreadsheets. I used Google Maps, because it was better than Microsoft's competitive version of the product. Till I had a chance to re-evaluate it again. This time around Microsoft has produces a better result. [Microsoft Live Maps](http://maps.live.com) gives me more than [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/) does (weird even to think it, not mentioning writing it :).

What made the difference? The level of details, an option of having a closer look, real images. Anyway, I am not using Live Maps.
