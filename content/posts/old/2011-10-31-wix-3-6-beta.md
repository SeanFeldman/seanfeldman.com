A while ago I had a conversation with a gentleman who resisted .NET development on the client side reasoning it that in case .NET framework doesn’t exist, installer won’t fail. [WiX 3.6 Beta](http://robmensching.com/blog/posts/2011/10/24/WiX-v3.6-Beta-released) is out and it solved the “problem”. Reminds me of situation when “business code needs to be efficient to take less memory” situation. We’ve all seen that code die slowly and painfully ![Smile](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/Windows-Live-Writer/WiX-3.6-Beta_78DA/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png)
