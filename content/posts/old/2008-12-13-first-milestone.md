I learned from a wise man that celebrating small successes as important as the having big one, if not even more. So today I would like to thank my team for the effort they made in such a short period of time and with a quiet a steep learning curve they had to go through. One picture is worth a thousand words.

Some statistics:

Project size - small

Project form scratch to functional all T/BDD time - 2 weeks\*

Team - no TDD, no principles, no solid OO till about 3 months only

Components - web components, windows service component

OSS projects used - NHibernate

Testing frameworks used - MbUnit 3, Rhino.Mocks 3.5, WatiN 2

Testing performed - unit, integration (load is not there yet, but I am sure next iteration it will)

\* we literally started from absolutely nothing, bringing no code from existing projects.

Great work team!
