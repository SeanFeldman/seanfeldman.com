In my [previous post](http://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/archive/2009/02/28/agile-stickies-board.aspx) I talked about efficiency of whiteboard with stickies as a tracking tool for a project progress. During last iteration, our PM has suggested to “color code” features with different color stikies. Boy it worked great. Apparently, this is a great way to ease progress reading for a specific feature.

To make it possible, we put the name of the feature with the appropriate color sticky on the top of the whiteboard. The rest – picture will prove it.

PS: the bottom left corner represents all known items in Backlog with low priority.

Done-done column is not captured here, it’s a whiteboard (smaller) on it’s own, that is getting slowly filled up with items form “In QA”, when those are accepted, and all associated items with it (from Dev. Complete) are moved.

PSS: The hot pink – these are the bugs, they get attached to the appropriate stickes in order to attract attention and get fixed ASAP (example in column “In Progress”).
