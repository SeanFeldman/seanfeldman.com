<p>This is an <a href="http://www.wave-vs.net" target="_blank">interesting plug-in</a> for VS.NET 2008/2010 to allow remote pair-programming. Iâ€™m a big advocate for pair-programming and collaborative work, so this plug-in has its place in the real world. I used to pair-program with a developer that was remote, and we used VNC/RDC, but this one is way better.</p>
