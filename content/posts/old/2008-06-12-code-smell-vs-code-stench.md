Interesting difference I picked up from a book this morning - code smell vs. code stench.

Code smell might indicate there's a problem in code that requires refactoring, but a closer evaluation might prove the smell is false alarm.

Code stench is an obviously bad/poor code that has to be refactored.

From now on I will be more accurate on describing the code issues :)
