There was a lot of noise generated by a blog [“The Duct Tape Programmer”](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html). There were lots of responses as well ([link](http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/09/24/the-duct-tape-programmer), [link](http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/debunking-the-duct-tape-programmer/), [link](http://devlicio.us/blogs/casey/archive/2009/09/25/ship-it-or-ship-out.aspx), [link](http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2009/09/26/the-duct-tape-programmer-some-thoughts/), [link](http://geekswithblogs.net/leesblog/archive/2009/09/26/the-backyard-mechanic.aspx), [link](http://www.rgoarchitects.com/nblog/2009/09/25/TheDuctTapeProgrammer.aspx), [link,](http://codebetter.com/blogs/ian_cooper/archive/2009/09/28/beating-the-duct-programmer-with-generic-domains-subdomains-and-core-domains.aspx) [link](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/scottcreynolds/archive/2009/09/29/smart-and-gets-things-done-right.aspx)…). The last one I read was from [Oren](http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2009/09/30/duct-tape-programmers.aspx), where he puts it plain – just don’t do it.

I have my reasons to disagree with the statement(s) Joel wrote in his blog, but probably the most important one is about testing. Probably the reason for that is because **I was** developing without TDD for quiet a while, and I saw the difference. To me tests are design, and if you drop them, well, hell with design. A good project has to have a good design, and design starts from code, expressed first in tests, and after that in production code.

PS: if you disagree, the trash bin in on your desktop, not at my blog comments. 10x
