I ran into a problem once in a QA environment, and it was unpleasant to handle. [Amr ElGarhy](http://amrelgarhy.com/blog/sending-mails-development-machine-without-actual-mail-server/) has showed a way “baked into” .NET how to overcome issues similar to the one I had – write emails straight into file system. Solutions is elegant and done through configuration file.
