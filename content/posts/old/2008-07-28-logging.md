Logging is the process in which trees are cut down for forest management and[![image](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/WindowsLiveWriter/60340555f10f_B992/image_thumb.png)](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/WindowsLiveWriter/60340555f10f_B992/image_2.png) timber. Logging is controversial due to its potential environmental and aesthetic impacts.

I am going to talk about other one, the one that is vital, helpful, and has positive impacts. Software logging.

Hosted projects are easier in terms of debugging and tracing issues - you have got all the control in case you are the host. Though in some cases even the fact that you hosting the application does not help. Then troubleshooting becomes painful if not impossible.

This is where Diagnostics Trace class was helpful to provide the data that would help to resolve an issue or two. But for the logging part - it wasn't the best tool out there. So I have decided to have a look at what others are using, and quite a dominant candidate was log4net OSS component. Any objections?
