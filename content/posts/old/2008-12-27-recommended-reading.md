I was asked a question today, what books I would recommend to read. Besides the those that I have already finished and a few that are still in pipeline, anything else that would contribute to the overall improving. The current list is:

* The Pragmatic Programmer
* Heads First - Design Patterns
* Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#
* Working Effectively with Legacy Code
* Domain Driven Design
* CLR via C#
* C# 3.0 in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference
* Effective Java
* Test Driven Development
* Patterns of Enterprise Applications Architecture
* Agile Database Techniques: Effective Strategies for the Agile Software Developer
* Pair Programming Illuminated
* The Art of Agile Development
* Fearless Change: Patterns for Introducing New Ideas
* Who Moved My Cheese
* xUnit Test Patterns
* Refactoring to Patterns
* Analysis Patterns: Reusable Object Models
* Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship
* Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development
* Test-Driven Development: A Practical Guide
* Continuous Integration - Improving Software Quality and Reducing Risk

The order doesn't really matter, though I would strongly recommend to read the first 5-6 books first, with "Who Moved My Cheese" in the middle. Other good books that you find useful - please feel free to recommend. If you are into Agile methodology, "The Art of Agile Development" and "Pair Programming Illuminated" are probably the best two starters.
