Watching Build event I couldnâ€™t not to smile. Microsoft is not always getting it right, but it looks like this time around they bet on a stronger horse. When .NET was released, ASP.NET was an attempt to bring desktop development to the web. Not the best approach. This time around, web development is coming to the desktop. Sounds interesting, and quite promising.
