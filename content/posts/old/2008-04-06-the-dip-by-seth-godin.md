An interesting book where author sharpens things that are quiet simple and have lots of common sense. I loved a few things that are very applicable to myself:

*Quit the wrong stuff. Stick with the right stuff. Have the guts to do one or the other.*

*People settle. They settle for less than they are capable of.*

*It's easier to be mediocre than it is to confront the reality and quit.*

*Time to look for a new job is when you don't need one. The time to switch jobs is before it feels comfortable. Challenge yourself.* 

*Failing means your dream is over.*
