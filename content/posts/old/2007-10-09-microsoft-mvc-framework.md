Alt.Net has definitely has generated the hype and excitement (well, at least for me). I heard in ScottGu's lecture thing I wanted to hear for quite long:

* Front Controller implemented

+ Requests are routed to Controllers

* Interface based request/response and the WHOLE framework - love it!
* Pluggable (Windsor, Spring)
* Testability and mocking baked in (NUnit, MbUnit, etc)
* Seems like the most of Design Principles were considered
* URL flexibility - mapping to controller with a friendly external names

+ Tokenized string (!!! Tokens - later about it)

* Controllers, Models, and Views are organized in folder structure (I can hear Glen saying "Yes!")

Highly recommended to watch the [video](http://www.hanselman.com/silverlight/ScottGuAtAltnetConf "ScottGu on MS MVC framework").
