Found this great excerpt in a book:

> Principles are guiding ideas and insights about a discipline, while practices are what you actually do to carry out principles. Principles are universal, but it is not always easy to see how they apply to particular environments. Practices, on the other hand, give specific guidance on what to do, but they need to be adapted to the domain. We believe that there is no such thing as a "best" practice; practices must take context into account. In fact, the problems that arise when applying metaphors from other disciplines to software development are often the result of trying to transfer the practices rather than the principles of the other discipline.

So true. How many times youâ€™ve heard software development compared to constructions or any other discipline?
