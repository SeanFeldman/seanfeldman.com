Just finished reading "[The Productive Programmer](http://www.amazon.ca/Productive-Programmer-David-Bock/dp/0596519788)" by Neal Ford. Mixed [![image](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/WindowsLiveWriter/TheProductiveProgrammer_12931/image_thumb.png)](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/WindowsLiveWriter/TheProductiveProgrammer_12931/image_2.png) emotions about the book. On one hand it's packed with good practices and decent tips to follow, on another hand haven't I watch the [presentation](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/10-Ways-to-Better-Code-Neal-Ford) on InfoQ, reading the book might be a bit more pleasant...

One good thought that I liked in the book especially - question the authorities. Exactly as the author of the book ran into the no acceptance of changing long-time structured naming conventions, same happened to myself recently in a team with a couple of "old school agile consultants" (no names :). And the most important lesson, don't turn into angry (code) monkey and beat other developers for fresh ideas.

PS: I do recommend to watch the [presentation](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/10-Ways-to-Better-Code-Neal-Ford), though. It's good.
