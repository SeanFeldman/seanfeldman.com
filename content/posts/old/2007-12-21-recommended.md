The training session I took with JP Boodhoo "Nothin But .NET" was awesome. Was quiet surprised that a variation of this course, "[Nothin But .NET Fundamentals](http://www.jpboodhoo.com/blog/NothinButNetFundametalsCollegeStationTXJanuary7th11th2008.aspx)" is not sold out yet. If you are anywhere near to College Station TX, and want to know what high-end fundamentals are - [register](http://www.jpboodhoo.com/blog/NothinButNetFundametalsCollegeStationTXJanuary7th11th2008.aspx) to this training session.

JP is a great guy and an awesome trainer. If you looking for challenge - you will get it. Fundamental will never be the same after you go through the session.

PS: As an ex-trainer I can assure you that you getting a high-class experience with no "canned" and "chewed" content. And this is rare these days.
