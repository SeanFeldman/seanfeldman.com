In my [last post](http://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/archive/2011/10/22/goodbye-nant-hello-psake.aspx) I have described the move from NAnt to PSake that is based on PowerShell. One missing piece for making the whole experience smooth was Visual Studio support for PowerShell syntax and some Intellisense. Gladly, I have run into [PowerGUIVsx](http://powerguivsx.codeplex.com/), that does just that: syntax highlighting, intellisense, and even debugging. Sweet!
