Our current project is moving towards the final phase. This is going to be the 1st release, and I am quiet excited to see how team work is transforming a bunch of stickies and tests into a real system. This is how our whiteboard looks like (done-done part was not captured, but it’s definitely there and has a significant amount) and tests result trend based on builds Hudson CI is running.

Backlog is empty, besides out-of-scope and low-priority items. Low-priority items are items that are “nice” to have, but can be sacrificed in order to have more important things done-done.
