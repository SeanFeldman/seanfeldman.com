So today is the day. I am 31 and a new iteration in my life has started. What are the features I am trying to achieve in this one? A few:

* Improve in my profession

+ Become better developer
+ Lead by example

* Become more active

+ At work place
+ Community (\*)

* Overcome a few of my own "border bullies" that I have started to face recently, but not done yet

And more than ever - "Never give up, never surrender".
