For all keyboard junkies out there - if you are also hooked on Google products (GMail, Reader, Calendar, etc), don't miss the option of using GMail with [keyboard shortcuts](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&ctx=mail&answer=6594). The are awesome. I loved the navigation shortcut (combination of pressing first G and then another key, neat).

To enable keyboard shortcuts, you will have to go to the settings under you GMail account and check off the option to enable it.
