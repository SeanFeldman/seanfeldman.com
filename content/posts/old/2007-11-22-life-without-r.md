<p>I am not making any news by saying what was said before - R# folks were surprised as much as we were by so early release of&nbsp;&nbsp;VS.NET 2008. I wonder what was the reason to this early release and how soon as a result of that we will be rushing to download SP1 for it... The point is not that. What I would suggest is do not run R# in VS.NET 2008 without proper support on R# side. Wait a bit, it will come. I am saying so because coding in VS.NET 2008 without fully capable R# running is&nbsp;PAIN... </p> <p>PS: Any ideas how soon R# will be updated to deal with reality?</p>
