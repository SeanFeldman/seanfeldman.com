I have posted [before](http://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/archive/2008/04/01/whiteboard-with-stickers-vs-excel.aspx) about the subject, and there was a strong hold on both sides (for and against). Yesterday I run into a blog that mentioned a software called Mingle 2.0 - obviously not the first version according to the name, but I have never heard of it before, so it might be a naming game (all the Web 2.0 thing) - who knows? And probably someone knows. If you a successful survivor of the software or haveÂ  a few words to drop, leave your comment after the beep.

Beeeeep.
