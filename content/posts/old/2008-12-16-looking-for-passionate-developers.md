Our team is growing and we are looking for passionate developers that go beyond the average. If you are looking for an environment that is all about software development, agile flavour, thinks out of Container, T/BDD spiced, .NET mixed with OSS, mapped with NHibernate, and willing to go beyond, then it's the place to join. We are located in Calgary (Canada) and will be happy to have you on board. Who is interested, can drop me a note at Feldman {dot} Sean {dot} at gmail {dot} com.
