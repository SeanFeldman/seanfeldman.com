Update: Mark Capaldi has revealed a great VS.NET shortcut that does the work (Shift-ESC).

Visual Studio floating windows are not playing nicely with keyboard shortcuts. If you only using a keyboard, and want to be able to navigate around without constantly getting destructed by a mice, it's ok. But floating windows are impossible to close without touching a mouse. At least I am not familiar with a way to do it. Imagine you could do something like this - press ALT-Space on floating window and... close!

Wouldn't it be nice? :)
