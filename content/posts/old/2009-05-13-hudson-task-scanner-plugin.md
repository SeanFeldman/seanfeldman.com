Seeing is believing. I was looking for a Hudson plugins that would allow me to present any TODOs left in the code. And as usual, found it (love that!). [Static Code Analysis Plugins](http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Static+Code+Analysis+Plug-ins) are useful when you need that type of information. In particular, I am talking about [Task Scanner Plugin](http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Task+Scanner+Plugin). The snapshot will tell everything.
