Among the features I love about Gmail is to be able to access multiple accounts w/o signing out and signing in. Iâ€™m late to learn this, but apparently you can do the same thing with Windows Live IDs. Same idea, straight forward.

The bonus is that you can control access to your account like LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Google. Very neat.
