As you probably know, the all new and shiny SP1 for both .NET framework and VS.NET 2008 are out. So I waited a bit, saw that other developers are accepting it and installed it. Great, worked smooth. Till I dared to restart. After that VS.NET 2008 designer "empowered by new abilities deployed with SP1" has showed own of it's hidden jams - complete crash of the IDE with no traces to what has just happened.

Google it. And so I did, reading wondering MS responses to others complaining about the same issue, such as "are you having the admin privileges"? Or better "make sure you uninstall A prior to installing C, but make sure D is not there, or you run the E utility to let you know that F is missing".

And I have a question - WTF?! Can't you guys deploy a normal SP and that's it? If there's a bunch of hotfixes, CTPs and betas that a developer is not using, why to let him go through the pain? And as well, why not to puck utilities to remove thins along or at least provide the link and not just on the forums?

I learned my lesson -- develop in a virtual box. At least that way the pain is not lasting for long (a few hours to recover, rather than a whole day to get to the same square you started from initially).
