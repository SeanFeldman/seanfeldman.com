If you are from Calgary area, and willing to join .NET team for [enterprise development](http://www.cortex.net) â€“ let me know. We are using .NET, BDD development style, not bleeding, but quite on the edge. If you like to develop quality software, and agile process is what you want, send me your resume at feldman [dot] sean [dot] work [at] gmail [dot] com.

On this note, we are also looking for a great system administrator that would rock virtualization.
