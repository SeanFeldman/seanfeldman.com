When developing code using TDD, you are unavoidably face the difficulties of maintaining 2 “project”s – production code and tests/specs. This is a Java code book, but principles are the same and applicable to .NET as well. Good read, though I would not tie too many hopes to the book. After all, you cannot learn how to shave on someone’s else beard.
