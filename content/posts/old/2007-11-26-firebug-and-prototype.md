Today had to spend a bit time on client side code for FireFox. Since I'm coming from IE development only, the whole thing was not so pleasant (plus the fact that either IE sins too much or FF is not really a saint, probably both). So I ended up with 2 things that literally saved my time - Prototype JavaScript framework and Firebug addon for FF. Great to things that just made my day.
