On my flight I had a chance to finish reading “[Code Leader](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0470259248)” by Patrick [![image](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/Media/image_thumb_23291310.png "image")](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/Media/image_5A62C6D6.png)Cauldwell. The book is a good source for ideas and concepts that “solid” developers should employ on a daily basis. Topics such as TDD, build vs. buy, CI, choosing the right tool for the right job, contract driven development, and much more.

The book goes over subjects showing tidbits of everything, and could be probably expended and extended at least several times more. But then it would probably become “[Clean Code](http://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)” and “[Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices](http://www.amazon.ca/Agile-Principles-Patterns-Practices-C/dp/0131857258)” clone, which author probably didn’t want to create.

Overall, I liked the book as an introduction to so many “Alt .NET” concepts in a single source. What I missed in this book is the human leadership in the code, the human-factor in code creation, the behaviour and interaction between people that work on the same software. IMHO, code leadership is not only superiority in machine code, but also in the team environment.
