We got two good developers applied and accepted to the company from what it looks through my blog. I have posted about 2 weeks ago that we are looking for developers. This is great! We need more people. [Same call](http://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/archive/2010/01/08/looking-for-good-developers.aspx) is still active.

Oh, and it tells me someone out there is actually reading the blog :)
