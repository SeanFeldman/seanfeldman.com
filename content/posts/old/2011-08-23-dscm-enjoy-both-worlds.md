A while ago, the team I was part of had a discussion about choosing the best DSCM (Distributed Source Code Management). Two candidate back then were [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) (Hg) and [Git](http://git-scm.com/). We were already using [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) and very accustomed to [VisualSVN](http://www.visualsvn.com/) in conjunction with [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/). Opinions split, time frames never allowed to actually make the switch and so the question remained unanswered: which one is to go with.

While there are a lot of blog posts stating what side to take, I personally went with Hg (partially due to its similarity in work with SVN I was used to). Yet there’s a lot of code that is hosted on Git repositories, and I wanted to access it as well. Commands for Hg and Git might not always have the same name, but the final result is similar. So why shouldn’t one be able to use a single tool to access both types of repositories? And surely a quick search has revealed [a way to do so](http://www.ffuts.org/blog/accessing-a-git-repository-with-tortoisehg-on-windows/) in a very easy way.
