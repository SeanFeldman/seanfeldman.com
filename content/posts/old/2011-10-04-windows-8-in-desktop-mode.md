Ironically, there are too many people predicting the “end of the world”. For Windows 8 Metro style UI doesn’t make sense if you are developing business applications or using a non-touch interface computer. Windows 8 allows to disable Metro UI (and by that also disables applications that are Metro UI applications) and puts UI into the “conventional” Window 7 look and feel. Registry key for explorer can allow you switching between Desktop and Metro UIs as mentioned in this [blog post](http://www.ghacks.net/2011/09/15/windows-8-start-menu-toggle-disable-enable-metro-ui/). So end of the world is postponed to some later days folks.
