I have [posted a question](http://groups.google.com/group/visualsvn/browse_thread/thread/2e877ba7e2ab3080) at VisualSVN user group in regards to reverting delete operation on an item in a project. The workaround is very much manual, and feels wrong. At this point I was either able to revert the change for the deleted file only and manually add it to the project, or revert both deleted file and modified project file, and manually remove the references to the files that are reported as 'missing'.
