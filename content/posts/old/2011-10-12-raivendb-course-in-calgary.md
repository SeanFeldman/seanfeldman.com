Ok, now that you actually looked at the post, here are the details.

I am looking into bringing [Oren Eini](http://ayende.com) to Calgary to teach [RavenDB](http://ravendb.net/) course. The group will not exceed 6-8 people, and we already have two participants willing to take it. This is a great deal, considering you saving almost 50% (flights, hotel, traveling time if not paid by your company). If you are from Calgary or around and willing to take the course, drop me a note at feldman {dot} sean {at} gmail {dot} com.
