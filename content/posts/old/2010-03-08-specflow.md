Specification based testing is kind of testing I prefer. Once in a while I like to see what’s available. This time, it was [SpecFlow](http://specflow.org) framework. Based on [Gherkin](http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/gherkin) style specification, it creates your specs, nicely integrating with Visual Studio .NET (I used 2008). This is what an output of a test written with SpecFlow looks like in VS2008 (used R# 5 Beta 2 for as a test runner).

```
Given I have entered 50 and 70 into the calculator
-> done: CalculatorStepDefinition.GivenIHaveEntered50And70IntoTheCalculator() (0.0s)
When I press add
-> done: CalculatorStepDefinition.WhenIPressAdd() (0.0s)
Then the result should be 120 on the screen
-> done: CalculatorStepDefinition.ThenTheResultShouldBe120OnTheScreen() (0.0s)

1 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, took 1.75 seconds (NUnit 2.5.3).
```

(-> done lines are an ugly addition that looked like o[![image](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/Media/image_thumb_22BE2619.png "image")](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/Media/image_19CE93DA.png)thers didn’t have. Either it was the new R# or something else). In overall, it’s a nice attempt to bring pure specification, readable and meaningful into code. I didn’t like the fact that there were so many artifacts to manage around though. On top of that, refactoring scenarios is not the most pleasant thing in the world, as technically I had to regenerate CalculatorStepDefinition.cs file.

Currently, out of box, SpecFlow is coupled to NUnit, but this is probably something that is just matter of templates re-configuration. I like the attempt, though would not use it on a project that is entirely developed with TDD and is frequently reworked.
