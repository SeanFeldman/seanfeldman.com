Firefighters are not analyzing the situation, they are taking several plans to consider leaving the simplest and the least harmful to be executed. Can be this applied anywhere? No. When you have stressful times in software development you need to enrich your knowledge and learn about the problem. Doesn't mean to put on hold the development. Neither it means to implement the firemen approach and forget about it. It means take out the fire and learn how to avoid fires in the future by implementing the proper solution when you can.

Note on that: I teach myself to respond and not to react. Reacting is more reflex style, where response is more weighted and analyzed answer. That way a dialog can take place that leads to a quicker decision on how to take the fire out, and not a spontaneous acts driven by emotions that lead to nothing, but fire swallowing more than it should have in first place.
