Seems like there's a bug in Rhino.Mocks 3.5 in regards to stubbed dependency (stubbing property getter and a behavior in certain order). Anyone knows something about it?

PS: have posts at both Rhino.Mocks [usergroup](http://groups.google.com/group/RhinoMocks/browse_thread/thread/b38d09b276e66ec7) and [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/510050/stubbing-property-getter-prior-to-method-on-the-same-object-rhino-mocks-3-5), but still no clue what's wrong.
