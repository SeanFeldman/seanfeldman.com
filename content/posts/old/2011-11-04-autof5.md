Just a few weeks ago I wrote a small application that would allow a designer to work on markup and CSS and when those are saved, changes automatically uploaded to an FTP and local browser that is usually sitting on the second monitor is refreshed. That was a fun side little app to do.

Today I run into another refresh-option-application[AutoF5](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/hongyes/archive/2011/11/03/introducing-to-autof5-nuget-package-live-editing-in-asp-net.aspx). It solves ASP.NET development issue with making changes to markup and CSS and refresh **locally**. Check it out, really nice and simple.
