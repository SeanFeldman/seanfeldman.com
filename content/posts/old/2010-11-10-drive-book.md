It started with [Jonathan](http://agilewarrior.wordpress.com) talking about the video he saw, [Drive: The surprising truth[![image](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/Media/image_017FC426.png "image")](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc) about what motivates us](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc). I really liked it, and decided to proceed to the book. The book is outstanding, hits in the target. Among other things, I can definitely use it to explain a good portion of things that happened to me in the past. What is interesting, is what Daniel Pink describes as “Drive”, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi describes as “Flow” (another book to read). I really liked the language and associations Pink has used in the book – software and computers. This makes analogies and examples extremely simple. Good read.
