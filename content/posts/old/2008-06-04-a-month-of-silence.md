My vacation with family in Israel almost over - packing luggage, sitting for the last time at cafes with people I will miss, enjoying the extra hot weather while it's more fun than burden. This vacation was a great refresh for the entire family: kids, wife, myself. Having a break from daily thoughts, code, work - feels that it has gave me more will to kick in and go forward that it felt a month ago. Speaking about going forward...

Going forward has to be directed. A list like JP and Mr. Mo suggested is a great idea. Having a master plan partitioned by timeline can be another concept. Sitting back and analyzing what has being accomplished, with what costs, and was it worth it or not is another way. I guess this is the path I went while staying on vacation. I see better what fights I should not go into - they are just not worth it and I have better things to do in my life. I can definitely distinguish better between friend and foe. I realize that tolerance is blessing, and a curse at the same time, and that it's my responsibility to make the judgment and deciding call what persist on and what to let go.

I am returning from vacation this time, knowing better what I want from myself. This will allow me to manage better my expectations from others, and hopefully, communicate better and spread the ideas I believe in. This time around I also know that I am coming back and there are friends waiting. This time the concept of "everything should be with good proportion" fits better than never. Enough of vacation, let's code!
