<p>There was an interesting observation made once, that to be happy with what you do, you have to have 2 out of 3 things which are Fun, Respect, and Money. If you have all three, then you are doing great. In case there is only one out of three, it is really up to your spirit, until you move on. Two is a reasonable number if you passionate about what you doing. </p> <p>From my personal observations, if you are really passionate, you can even have one out of three, and in most cases that would be the Fun of improving yourself, learning, and going forward giant steps, ignoring some of the reality pains associated with it. But if you loose the Fun, you loose the passion. </p>
