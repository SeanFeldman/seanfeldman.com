For [automated deployments of BizTalk application](http://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/archive/2010/06/22/automated-builds-and-deployment-for-biztalk.aspx), I am using MsBuild scripts packaged with compiled BizTalk artifacts. Build scripts are in NAnt. I wanted from NAnt build script to update MsBuild deployment script.

MsBuild deployment script looked like this:

For this task NAnt XmlPoke is the right tool to use, except that this didnâ€™t work, until I realized that I need to use namespace prefix. Once prefix ***msb*** was in place, it worked as charm.
