<p>I was exposed to an interesting product from innotek called <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a>. If you like MS VPC or VMWare, check this one out. It's free, it's not bad (so far I was just playing with it installing Windows XP and running some applications on a quiet slow host machine). Would love to hear others comments on this one, or any other alternative that is welcomed.</p>
