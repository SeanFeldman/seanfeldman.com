There’s another kid on the .NET obfuscation block – totally free and plays nicely with command line - [Eazfuscator.NET](http://www.foss.kharkov.ua/g1/projects/eazfuscator/dotnet/Default.aspx). It also has a [NuGet package](http://nuget.org/List/Packages/eazfuscator.net) available for download, though it’s not up-to-date.
