In my [previous blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/archive/2008/10/23/domain-object-and-contracts.aspx) about domain objects and contracts for those, I have described the situation where the team was thinking in a different way than myself, and what we tried. I have never blogged back about the fact that the team got convinced that this is not a good practice, and long time ago we stopped doing that. Today I spotted a [blog post](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jagregory/archive/2009/05/09/entity-interface-anti-pattern.aspx) from [James Gregory](http://www.lostechies.com/members/jagregory/default.aspx) where he names it properly “an anti-pattern”. That’s what it is. End of the story.
