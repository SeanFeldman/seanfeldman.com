*This is personal content post.*

Yesterday I celebrated my birthday. My son, who’s almost six and is discovering the beauty of math, asked me how old I will be this birthday. On what I decided to puzzle him a bit and answered “two in power of five” (he knows plus, minus, multiplication and that’s it). To my surprise, he had an answer figured for himself quite fast. “Dad, so you are really young! 25 only, cool.”

I never had a chance to reflect back, but looking at things now, Liam and Liz were the best gifts I got from my wife.
