If you are a fan of electronic music, and happen to find yourself in a place where there’s not a single radio station playing electronic music – this is the URL to remember: [http://www.di.fm/](http://www.di.fm/ "http://www.di.fm/")

Thanks goodness there’s internet…

PS: Yes, I am located in Calgary :) Shash!
