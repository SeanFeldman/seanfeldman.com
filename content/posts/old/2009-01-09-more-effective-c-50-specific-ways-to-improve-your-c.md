This is an interesting [book](http://www.amazon.ca/More-Effective-C-Specific-Improve/dp/0321485890) to read in case your reading queue is empty[![image](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/WindowsLiveWriter/50Ways_12973/image_thumb.png)](https://aspblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/sfeldman/WindowsLiveWriter/50Ways_12973/image_2.png) and you want to brush up some aspects of C# (2/3). I can't recommend this book as a general reading, as it's way too narrowed to specific subjects (or implementation of those). Saying this, I really loved the introduction into expressions and functional pieces in C#. It gives you the hint what's going on, leaving a taste of more to read.

PS: IsmaÃ«l, thank you for letting us have it ;)
