One of the books from my [reading](http://amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2J45ANE21AADN/ref=cm_wl_rlist_go/102-3703351-4545710) [wish list](http://amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/3C19BBVB54L81/ref=cm_wl_rlist_go/102-3703351-4545710) has finally made it - [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321127420/ref=wl_it_dp/102-3703351-4545710?ie=UTF8&coliid=I3S9Q0A8RJJE2K&colid=2J45ANE21AADN) by Marin Fowler. Interesting reading so far. The book was advised by JP Boodhoo. I'd love to hear other good books recommendations with preferably less Coffee examples :)
