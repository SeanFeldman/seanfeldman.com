## Hi, I'm Sean Feldman

I'm a 20+ year .NET developer passionate about building reliable, scalable systems and sharing knowledge through code and writing.

Over the years, I've worked extensively with Azure, messaging patterns, distributed systems, and modern .NET development practices. This blog is where I share my thoughts, experiments, and lessons learned along the way.
